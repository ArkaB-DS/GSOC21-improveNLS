abstract = {This paper is the result of concerted efforts to break the barrier between numerical accuracy and run-time efficiency in computing the fundamental decomposition of numerical linear algebra—the singular value decomposition (SVD) of general dense matrices. It is an unfortunate fact that the numerically most accurate one-sided Jacobi SVD algorithm is several times slower than generally less accurate bidiagonalization-based methods such as the QR or the divide-and-conquer algorithm. Our quest for a highly accurate and efficient SVD algorithm has led us to a new, superior variant of the Jacobi algorithm. The new algorithm has inherited all good high accuracy properties of the Jacobi algorithm, and it can outperform the QR algorithm.},

If used in the preconditioned Jacobi SVD algorithm, described in part one of this paper, it delivers superior performance leading to the currently fastest method for computing SVD decomposition with high relative accuracy. Furthermore, the efficiency of the new algorithm is comparable to the less accurate bidiagonalization-based methods. The paper also discusses underflow issues in floating point implementation and shows how to use perturbation theory to fix the imperfectness of the machine arithmetic.},

abstract = {A new software for computing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of real or complex matrices is proposed. The method implemented in the code xGESVDQ is essentially the QR SVD algorithm available as xGESVD in LAPACK. The novelty is an extra step, the QR factorization with column (or complete row and column) pivoting, also already available in LAPACK as xGEQP3. For experts in matrix computations, the combination of the QR factorization and an SVD computation routine is not new. However, what seems to be new and important for applications is that the resulting procedure is numerically superior to xGESVD and that it is capable of reaching the accuracy of the Jacobi SVD. Further, when combined with pivoted Cholesky factorization, xGESVDQ provides numerically accurate and fast solvers (designated as xPHEVC, xPSEVC) for the Hermitian positive definite eigenvalue problem. For instance, using accurately computed Cholesky factor, xPSEVC computes all eigenvalues of the 200 \texttimes{} 200 Hilbert matrix (whose spectral condition number is greater that 10300) to nearly full machine precision. Furthermore, xGESVDQ can be used for accurate spectral decomposition of general (indefinite) Hermitian matrices.},
