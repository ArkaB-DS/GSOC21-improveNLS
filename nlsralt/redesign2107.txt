1) set up resfun and rjfun in model2resfun and model2rjfun. Can we do both in one routine?

2) Look to see if we can set up "m" object after the fact. 
   Need to add a bunch of functions. 

3) subset in nlfb, not before.

and/or

4) set up a subsetnls() function to output new problem object with 
   data subsetted.

5) we create rjfun by get rjexpr <- deriv(residexpr, names(pvec)),
   then evaluating. However, we should be able to test rjexpr.
