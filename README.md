# ImproveNLS

Efforts to improve the functioning of the R nls() function for nonlinear least 
squares estimation. This is part of the Google Summer of Code for 2021.

The Google Summer of Code student on this project is Arkajyoti Bhattacharjee, 
Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.

The proposing mentor is John C. Nash, Telfer School of Management, University of Ottawa,
supported by Heather Turner, University of Warwick, and Hans Werner Borchers.

We welcome collaboration on this project. Given the very wide range of applications
and features of the nls() function, however, it is almost certain that only some
possibilities will be addressed in the project. Our aim is to focus attention on 
actions that can be realized in future versions of the installable R system.
