\maketitle

\abstract{%
Nonlinear least squares (nls) is extensively used in nonlinear modeling.
This paper introduces the package \textbf{nlsCompare} that attempts to
compare the best values of parameters and sum-of-squares in nls problems
with existing packages' fiunctions for nls like
\texttt{nls}(\textbf{base}), \texttt{nlsLM}(\textbf{minpack.lm}) and a
new package \textbf{nlsj} developed by the authors as a product of
Google Summer of Code (GSoC), 2021.
}

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

While working on the GSoC project \textbf{Improvements to nls()} under
The R Project for Statistical Computing, the authors realized that to be
able to compare the improvements made via \texttt{nlsj} and in general,
to help future developers in the sphere of nls , one needs to compare
existing packages for nls in R with the best observed reference values.

\textbf{nlsCompare}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  contains test data files based on packages like \textbf{NRAIA}
\item
  contains spreadsheets containing the methods (solvers, algorithms,
  control settings) to compare
\item
  generates easy-to-read spreadsheets that compare existing or new
  packages for nls with the best reference values yet observed
\item
  gives appropriate messages to understand errors or where to do
  improvements
\end{itemize}

\textbf{nlscompare} draws inspiration from R's testing library
\textbf{testthat} and uses ideas from packages like
\textbf{benchmarkme}. Currently, this has been developed keeping the R
environment in mind.

\hypertarget{need-for-nlscompare}{%
\subsection{Need for nlsCompare}\label{need-for-nlscompare}}

Regression testing is useful not only to validate correctness of a
program but often also for tracking the quality of its output. While
working on improving \texttt{nls}, author\(^2\) noted that to compare
the improvements made over \texttt{nls} via \textbf{nlsj}, unit testing
via \textbf{testthat} is not enough. To be able to add more improvements
to \textbf{nlsj}, it is required to compare it with other existing
packages' nls functions. This would allow us to note which methods are
supported by one function, but not in another and to check the
consistency of same results from different functions.

\textbf{nlscompare} attempts to achieve the above, outputting a simple
informative spreadsheet that indicates whether an existing or new
package's function provides consistent results with the current best
obseved values. Further, it outputs an error log that indicates whether
a solver (viz.~\texttt{nls} or \texttt{nlsLM}, etc.) fail in a
particular problem with particular methods (algorithms, starting points,
etc.)

\hypertarget{workflow}{%
\subsection{Workflow}\label{workflow}}

The \textbf{nlscompare} needs to be run in the following hierarchical
steps -

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{setup\_dir()}: choose and set the working directory save final
  csv outputs.
\item
  \texttt{machineId()}: create the machine ID to be used in the output
  csv files.
\item
  \texttt{create\_db()}: create dataframe to store database of nls
  problems
\item
  \texttt{create\_elog()}: create dataframe to store error-log in
  solving the nls problems
\item
  \texttt{csv\_exists}: check if the csv files \textbf{nlsDatabase.csv}
  and \textbf{nlsErrorLog.csv} exist already in the directory chosen in
  1. Create them if not present
\item
  \texttt{run()}: this uses the problem names - \textbf{Name} , the
  reference values - \textbf{nPars}, \textbf{Parameters} and
  \textbf{ssquares} from \textbf{problems.csv} , the methods from
  \textbf{methods.csv}, does the comparisons and error logging and edits
  the dataframes accordingly.
\item
  \texttt{write\_csvs}: write the dataframes returned by \texttt{run}
  into \textbf{nlsDatabase.csv} and \textbf{nlsErrorLog.csv}
\item
  \texttt{rm\_nls} : delete the global variables created due to running
  of the above functions
\end{enumerate}

A detailed explanation on how to install and use the package is
available in the package vignette -

How to Use it?}

\hypertarget{package-content-details}{%
\subsection{Package content details}\label{package-content-details}}

\hypertarget{methods.csv}{%
\subsubsection{methods.csv}\label{methods.csv}}

This csv file contains three columns:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{solver:} This is the name of the function to be used to solve
  the nls problem. Currently, it supports \texttt{nlsj::nlsj},
  \texttt{nls}, \texttt{nlsr::nlxb} and \texttt{minpack.lm::nlsLM}.
\item
  \textbf{algorithm:} This is the name of the algorithm used. Currently,
  supports \texttt{default}, \texttt{plinear}, \texttt{port},
  \texttt{LM} and \texttt{marquardt}.
\item
  \textbf{control:} This contains the package function and its
  associated control settings to control the iterations
\end{enumerate}

The \textbf{methods.csv} file is used only extenstively inside the
\texttt{run} function.

Users can add new solvers, algorithms and controls as in the existing
csv file.

\hypertarget{problems.csv}{%
\subsubsection{problems.csv}\label{problems.csv}}

This csv file contains four columns:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Name:} This contains the names of files present in the
  \textbf{./nlsCompare/inst/scripts} of the package and is used by the
  \texttt{run()} function to source the \textbf{Name}-ed files inside
  the function.
\item
  \textbf{ssquares:} This contains the best (least) possible sum of
  squares achievable in the nls problem as present in the
  \textbf{Name}-ed file.
\item
  \textbf{nPars:} The number of parameters in the nls problem present in
  a \textbf{Name}-ed file.
\item
  \textbf{Pars:} This and the adjacent columns contain the best
  parameter values of the nls problem present in the \textbf{Name}-ed
  file. The number of adjacent columns that contain parameter values are
  \textbf{nPars}-1.
\end{itemize}

The ``best'' values are based on the observations made by the authors on
using different nls packages. These ``best'' values serve as a reference
that is used inside the \texttt{run} function to compare with a
\textbf{solver}'s output using the corresponding \textbf{algorithm} and
\textbf{control}. In case a user finds a ``better'' (see below) value,
the values inside this csv should be changed manually by the user.

\hypertarget{nlscompareinstscripts}{%
\subsubsection{./nlsCompare/inst/scripts}\label{nlscompareinstscripts}}

This directory contains the R scripts for numeriou problems in nls that
are sourced inside the \texttt{run} function. Each file has a naming
structure: ``problemName\_x'' where x is a integer number. ``1'' means
that it is a parent test file of the ``problemName'' family of test
files. The parent file mainly contains -

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{NLSdata}: A dataframe that contains the data
\item
  \texttt{NLSformula}: nonlinear model formula
\item
  \texttt{NLSstart}: Starting values for the nls problem
\item
  \texttt{NLSlower}: An lower bound for the nls problem
\item
  \texttt{NLSupper}: An upper bound for the nls problem
\item
  \texttt{NLSweights}: weights for the nls problem
\item
  \texttt{NLSsubset}: for subsetting the dataframe
\item
  \texttt{NLSmethods}: a dataframe that stores the contents of
  \textbf{methods.csv}
\item
  \texttt{NLSproblems}: a dataframe that stores the contents of
  \textbf{problems.csv}
\item
  \texttt{refsol}: the package name that gives the best results to an
  nls problem listed in \textbf{problems.csv}
\item
  \texttt{NLSssquares}: the sum of squares produced by \textbf{refsol}.
  This is derived from \textbf{problems.csv}'s \textbf{ssquares} column
\item
  \texttt{NLSpars}: the parameters produced by \textbf{refsol}. This is
  derived from \textbf{problems.csv}'s \textbf{Pars} and its adjacent
  columns
\item
  \texttt{NLStag}: a tag to classify the nls problem
\item
  \texttt{NLSref}: nls object created using \textbf{refsol} to a problem
\end{itemize}

If x in "\_x" is greater than 1, it means that it is a children test
file belonging to the same "problemName family of test files. It
contains a subset of the contents as mentioned above. For example,
\emph{NLSprob\_2.R} may contain just a new \texttt{NLSstart} or may
contain \texttt{NLSupper} and \texttt{NLSlower} and so on.

To add ``children'' scripts, the naming convention is compulsory.
``NLSproblemName.x'' must have the x value just succeeding the last x
value for the same \emph{problemName}.

\hypertarget{coverage}{%
\subsection{Coverage}\label{coverage}}

The idea of hierarchy in test files allows to cover -

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  multiple starting values that may be good, or infeasible
\item
  bounded problems having a good or silly bounds
\item
  multiple weights for the same problem that comprise of good or bad
  weights
\item
  ability to work with subsets of the problem's data
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{methods.csv} allows the possibility to cover existing and
new packages' -

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  functions as \textbf{solver}s viz.~\texttt{nlsj::nlsj},
  \texttt{nlsr::nlxb} and \texttt{minpack.lm::nlsLM}
\item
  existing and new \textbf{algorithm}s viz.~``marquardt'', ``plinear'',
  ``port'' and ``Gauss-Newton'' and its variants
\end{itemize}

The \texttt{run()} function compares essential estimation quantities
like -

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  parameters
\item
  sum of squares
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{package-output-files}{%
\subsection{Package Output Files}\label{package-output-files}}

\hypertarget{nlsdatabase.csv}{%
\subsubsection{nlsDatabase.csv}\label{nlsdatabase.csv}}

This csv file stores a final output of the \texttt{run()} function. It
has 11 columns -

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{DateTime}: the data and time (space-separated) the program
  runs a particular \textbf{FileName}
\item
  \texttt{MachID}: a one-line machine summary useful for characterizing
  different machines
\item
  \texttt{FileName}: the name of the file run inside the \texttt{run()}
  function. It is used from \textbf{Problems.csv}
\item
  \texttt{Solver}: the nls function used from \textbf{methods.csv} to
  solve a nonlinear problem
\item
  \texttt{Algorithm}: the algorithm used from \textbf{methods.csv} to
  solve a nonlinear problem
\item
  \texttt{Control}: the control settings used from \textbf{methods.csv}
  to solve a nonlinear problem
\item
  \texttt{Parameters}: result on comparing \textbf{Refsol} parameter
  values with that of \textbf{Solver}'s. It is \texttt{TRUE} if both are
  equal, a \texttt{NUMERIC} indicating a ``Mean relative difference''
  and \texttt{NA} if the \textbf{solver} fails to run.
\item
  \texttt{SSquares}: result on comparing \textbf{Refsol} sum of squares
  value with that of \textbf{Solver}'s. It is \texttt{TRUE} if both are
  equal, a \texttt{NUMERIC} indicating a ``Mean relative difference''
  and \texttt{NA} if the \textbf{solver} fails to run.
\item
  \texttt{Better}: comment based on \textbf{Parameters} and
  \textbf{SSquares}. It is \texttt{EQUAL} if both are \texttt{TRUE},
  \texttt{BETTER} if \emph{SSquares(Solver)} is less than
  \emph{SSquares(refsol)} and \texttt{Worse} otherwise.
\item
  \texttt{RefSol}: the package that gives the best parameter and sum of
  squares value for a problem. \texttt{NLStag} is used here.
\item
  \texttt{Tags}: the tag used to classifiy the problem. \texttt{NLStag}
  value is used here.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{nlserrorlog.csv}{%
\subsubsection{nlsErrorLog.csv}\label{nlserrorlog.csv}}

This csv file stores a final output of the \texttt{run()} function and
is essentially an error-log. Further, it is a subset of the
\textbf{nlsDatabase.csv} which stores information of only those files
which on which a particular \emph{solver} does not run. It has 7 columns
-

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{DateTime}: the data and time (space-separated) the program
  runs a particular \textbf{FileName}
\item
  \texttt{MachID}: a one-line machine summary useful for characterizing
  different machines
\item
  \texttt{FileName}: the name of the file run inside the \texttt{run()}
  function that observed an error.
\item
  \texttt{Solver}: the nls function used from \textbf{methods.csv} that
  caused the error in solving \textbf{FileName} problem
\item
  \texttt{Algorithm}: the algorithm used from \textbf{methods.csv} to
  solve the nonlinear problem
\item
  \texttt{Control}: the control settings used from \textbf{methods.csv}
  to solve the nonlinear problem
\item
  \texttt{Message}: the error message associated with the problem that
  comes from the \texttt{Solver}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{some-observations}{%
\subsection{Some observations}\label{some-observations}}

On using \textbf{nlsCompare}, we have made some observations that point
towards the usefulness of the package -

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{nlsDatabase.csv} gave us an example (Croucher\_1.R,
  Croucher\_2.R, etc.) where a solver indeed turned out to be better
  than the reference solver that was known to be the best to us
\item
  ??hex problem
\item
  \textbf{nlsDatabase.csv} shows which packages fail in a problem and
  which succeed
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{future-work}{%
\subsection{Future work}\label{future-work}}

A few things we would like to incorporate in \textbf{nlsCompare} -

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  add other estimation quantities like \textbf{Convergence},
  \textbf{Rmat} and \textbf{Jacobian}
\item
  add \texttt{run\_specific} that runs a particular file or a list of
  files rather than all files as is listed in \textbf{problems.csv}
\item
  automatically update the reference values in the R scripts in
  ./nlsCompare/inst/scripts on encountering with ``better'' values and
  use \textbf{pkgVersion} and\textbf{LastUpdated} columns in
  \textbf{problems.csv} to keep track
\item
  add robust bound checking mechanisms like \texttt{optimx::bmchk}
\item
  include more problems in the database; for example, from
  \textbf{NISTnls}
\end{itemize}
