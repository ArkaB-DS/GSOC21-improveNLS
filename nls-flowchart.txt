  --> nls() [approx line 452 of file nls.R]
      Large number of statements to check the input.
      Then an important statement [approx line 616 of file nls.R]
      "m <-  " which creates the "model" object. This includes the
      relative offset convergence test. Where should we document the
      structure and use of "m" ??

      ## Iterate  [approx line 621 of nls.R]
      Here is critical part of the code for adding Marquardt or other
      modification to the nls() function. 
      The key work is, unfortunately, done in the line
         convInfo <- .Call(C_nls_iter, m, ctrl, trace) [approx line 628 of nls.R]
      --> R-devel/src/library/stats/src/nls.c (and associated nls.h and nls.d)
         The associated files are part of the structure of code for C programs
         (which JN does NOT normally do. We may want to get advice from someone who
          programs in C.) Some possibly useful pages are
